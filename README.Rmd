The `autobahn` package provides an R interface to the 
[Autobahn App API](https://autobahn.api.bund.dev/). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `autobahn` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r install_github, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("flrd/autobahn")
```

## What will you get
`autobahn` provides bindings to fetch data from the Autobahn App API, see the
[API documentation on their Swagger UI](https://autobahn.api.bund.dev/) for 
more information. 

The nomenclature of the functions follows the names of the resource identifiers 
(URI) of the endpoints:

- `autobahn_roadworks()`
- `autobahn_parking_lorry()`
- `autobahn_warning()`
- `autobahn_closure()`
- `autobahn_electric_charging_station()`

The one exception to this rule is the function `autobahnen()` which calls
https://verkehr.autobahn.de/o/autobahn/ and returns all autobahns in Germany, see
Examples section below.


### Examples

Get a list of all Autobahnen in Germany:

```{r autobahnen, eval=TRUE}
library(autobahn)
autobahnen() |> head()
```

Get a list of all electric charging stations on autobahn "A9":

```{r A9_as_is, eval=TRUE}
A9 <- autobahn_electric_charging_station(roadId = "A9")
A9[[1]]
```

Each of the `autobahn_*` functions has two arguments:

1. `roadId`
2. `return`

The first is the identifier of a autobahn, the second argument can take one of
two values: `"as-is"`, and `"simplified"`. Default is `"as-is"` and the data
is returned -- well -- as is. If you choose the option `"simplified"` then the
data is returned in a way that shall make it easier for you to work with it.

```{r A9_simple, eval=TRUE}
A9_simple <- autobahn_electric_charging_station(roadId = "A9", return = "simplified")
A9_simple[[1]]
```
